    Troubleshooting
1. Accessing the Infrastructure
    Bastion Server
    To access the infrastructure, connect to the Bastion server first using SSH:

    bash
    Copy code
    ssh -i your_key.pem ec2-user@bastion_ip
    From the Bastion server, you can then access other resources within the private network.

2. Monitoring and Alerts
    CloudWatch
    View system and application logs in CloudWatch.
    Set up alarms for important metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space.
    Monitor RDS performance insights for database performance.
3. Database Operations
    RDS (PostgreSQL)
    Use appropriate database clients to connect to the RDS instance.
    Perform database queries, updates, and maintenance tasks as required.
    Avoid direct access to the RDS instance from outside the VPC.
4. Backup and Restore
    Database Backup
    RDS PostgreSQL is configured for weekly backups.
    Backups are retained for 4 weeks.
    To restore a database from backup, use the AWS Management Console or CLI.
5. Scaling
    Autoscaling
    Autoscaling is configured based on CPU and memory usage.
    Minimum of 1 instance and scales up to 2 instances.
    Monitor scaling events and adjust scaling policies as necessary.
6. Security
    Security Groups
    Ensure security groups are correctly configured to restrict access to necessary ports.
    Review and update security group rules as required.
    Network ACLs
    Network ACLs are configured with custom rules for different subnets.
    Review and update NACL rules as necessary.
7. Troubleshooting
    CloudTrail
    Use CloudTrail to monitor and alert on unauthorized access attempts.
    Investigate any suspicious activity reported by CloudTrail.
    Log Analysis
    Analyze CloudWatch logs for errors or issues.
    Investigate and troubleshoot any application or system-related issues.
    Check RDS performance insights for database performance issues.
